# Introduction


Aha! is a video-language model designed to recognize when enough information has been observed in a video, triggering reflection and segmentation at the right moments, just like human intuition during "Aha!" moments.

Unlike traditional video-language models that process continuously or respond at fixed intervals, Aha! dynamically determines when to pause, analyze, and extract key moments based on contextual importance.

By fine-tuning Qwen-7B with an importance-aware segmentation mechanism and integrating uncertainty-based decision-making, Aha! intelligently:
- Segments video streams when enough information is available
- Ranks and extracts key moments using task-aware importance scoring
- Generates highlight reels with structured summarization techniques

This approach enables more efficient video understanding, making Aha! applicable to autonomous agents, surveillance, video summarization, and decision-support systems.


# Installation
1. Create conda environment and use pip to install some packages
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aiden200/Aha-.git
cd aha

conda create -n aha python=3.10
conda activate aha
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


2. Install torch compiled with cuda. Install them together using the instructions provided by [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org).


3. Install llava. If you run into any issues check the [official repository download instructions.](https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT)
```bash
cd LLaVA_NeXT
pip install -e ".[train]"
cd ..
```

4. Install flash-attention following the instructions in [https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). If you have difficulties installing it, add `--attn_implementation sdpa` in every command to use the sdpa implementation of transformer attention for train or inference.
```bash
MAX_JOBS=4 pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation --no-cache-dir 
```

5. Optional: you can download the weights of the model from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/aiden200/aha), or you can let the script automatically download the weights every run.
<!-- 5. Download MMDuet checkpoints from HuggingFace: [https://huggingface.co/wangyueqian/MMDuet](https://huggingface.co/wangyueqian/MMDuet) and put the files under folder `./outputs/mmduet`.

```bash
mkdir outputs
cd outputs
git clone https://huggingface.co/wangyueqian/MMDuet mmduet
cd ..
``` -->

<summary> Common Problems </summary>

*Note 1:* If you get a `bitsandbytes` error, try running:
```bash
pip uninstall bitsandbytes
pip install bitsandbytes
```
*Note 2:* If you get a `Undefined symbol cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol:` error, try running:
```
pip uninstall flash-attn
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation --no-cache-dir
```
*Note 3:* If you get some kind of `c10 deprecation` error, your pytorch version might be too high. The authors used the version:
- `Python==3.10`
- `torch == 2.5.1`
- `torchvision==0.20.1`
- `cuda12.4`

```bash
pip3 install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

*Note 4:* If you want to use the CPU adam optimizer with deepspeed, you need to install it with the correct flags:
```bash
DS_BUILD_CPU_ADAM=1 DS_BUILD_UTILS=1 \
pip install deepspeed \
  --global-option="build_ext" \
  --global-option="-j8"
```

# Inference
## Download Our model
<!-- 
## Download pretrained Model
- Download checkpoints from HuggingFace: (https://huggingface.co/aiden200/Aha-) and put the files under folder `./outputs/aha`
```bash
mkdir outputs
cd outputs
git clone https://huggingface.co/aiden200/Aha- aha

# Preparing the metadata
Download the datasets folder which contains the metadata for our dataset. You can download them from our [huggingface page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aiden200/aha-annotationsv1/tree/main). 

Use the following commands:
```
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/aiden200/aha-annotationsv1
mv aha-annotationsv1/datasets .
rm -rf aha-annotationsv1
```

This should give you a structure like this.

# Evaluation

  - Run `scripts/inference/tvsum.sh`.

- Mr.Hisum data preparation

  - Prepare the shot2Story videos following the [official instructions](https://huggingface.co/mhan/shot2story-videos). Place them in `datasets/shot2story/videos` folder.
  - Go to `scripts/inference/magqa.sh` and update the `GROQ_API_KEY` (if using online inference for llama-3.3 70B) and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required).
  - **Note:** You need at least 140GB of VRAM locally to run a quantized version of a 70B llama model. 
  - Run `scripts/inference/magqa.sh`

- Charades data preparation
  - Prepare the Charades videos following the [official instructions](https://prior.allenai.org/projects/charades). Place them in `datasets/charades/videos` folder.
  - Run `scripts/inference/charades.sh`

  - Run `scripts/inference/qvh.sh`

# Training

## Data preparation
- Mr.Hisum data preparation
  - Prepare the `mr_hisum.h5` file following the instructions of the [official repo](https://github.com/MRHiSum/MR.HiSum). 
  - Place the `mr_hisum.h5` file in the `datasets/hisum/annotations` folder.
  - Download the train youtube videos and place them in the `datasets/hisum/videos` folder.
- Shot2Story data preparation
  - Prepare the shot2Story videos following the [official instructions](https://huggingface.co/mhan/shot2story-videos). 
  - Place them in `datasets/shot2story/videos` folder.
- COIN data preparation
  - Prepare the COIN videos following the [official instructions](https://coin-dataset.github.io/).
  - Place the videos in the `datasets/coin/videos` folder.



Since some of these datasets (especially Mr.HiSum) are very big, you can always specify the video path in the `configs/datasets/aha_config.json` file where the datasets exist on your local machine.  

*note:* I've left a script to help the download processes at `datasets/download_tools`

When running training code for the first time, the dataset code will traverse all videos of the training dataset and measure the frame rate, duration, number of frames, and the corruption status of the videos. It will store this information in `datasets/${dataset_name}/videos_metadata.json`. This can take some time, since some of these datasets are very large.

- Following MMDuet's labeling process, download [paraphrase-en.gz](https://github.com/lichengunc/refer/raw/refs/heads/master/evaluation/meteor/data/paraphrase-en.gz) (59MB) which is used for dense video captioning evaluation. Put this file at `test/dvc/metrics/data/paraphrase-en.gz`



## Run the training script
Log into wandb in order to monitor your progress
```bash
wandb login [YOUR_API_KEY]
```

Log into huggingface in order to save your new model weights 
```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

and update `models.arguments_live`. Set `push_to_hub` as `False` if you do not wish to upload your new weights.

```python
push_to_hub=True,
hub_model_id=[REPO NAME],
```


Start the training process
```bash
bash ./scripts/train.sh
```

## Linear Grid search

If you wish to test out your new model, you will need to find out which $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\epsilon$ works best. Run a linear grid search using (uncomment the datasets you wish to tune in the file - advised to tune one by one):

```bash
bash ./scripts/inference/grid_search.sh
```

This will automatically update the hyperparameters in `outputs/grid_search_params.json`. Just run the evaluation scripts and it will give you the best result!


## Distributed Training
This model is very big, trained on 8 V100 GPUs, and you will probably need to utilize distributed training. [I've included instructions on how to train on the cloud, using Paperspace.](instructions/distributed_instructions.md)

# Fine-tuning

If you wish to further tune the trained weights, download the pretrained model from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/aiden200/aha) and put the files under folder `./outputs/aha`

```bash
mkdir outputs
cd outputs
git clone https://huggingface.co/aiden200/aha aha
cd ..
```

In the `scripts/train.sh` file, add this line:
```--lora_pretrained outputs/aha  \```
